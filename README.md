# Books I've Read

The Books I've Read application is a little learning project written by [yours truly.](http://www.bradseverance.com) It features an administration back-end that allows the user to manage books and import information about books from the [goodreads.com api.](https://www.goodreads.com/api)

The Books I've Read application is built on the following technologies:

+ [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

+ [passport](http://passportjs.org/)
+ [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
+ [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
+ [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
